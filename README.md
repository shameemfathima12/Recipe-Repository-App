# Recipe-Repository-App
This is a recipe app where you can save your recipes and the ingredients , as you can add, view, delete, edit the recipes.
To ensure that the recipes added to the application are maintained for a longer period and not deleted accidentally, we can enhance the application to save the recipes to a file when they are added or edited. This way, the recipes will persist even if the application is closed and reopened.
In the provided code, we're using the tkinter package, which is a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python.
